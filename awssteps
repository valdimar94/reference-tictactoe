After setting up AWS ECS and AWS command line interface:
Log in to AWS, here you must have AWS credentials awailable on the AWS account
The credentials are downloaded to the machine and need to be stored.
To log in, enter:
aws configure
Here enter credentials.

For the next step, an EC2 instance needs to be launched from the
AWS console. The top option is picked and then press Review and Launch.
Entering the instances window, here all instances can be seen. Notice
the Public IP address in the description, save that.

Now a connection needs to be established to the instance running
on the AWS server.
In the terminal, locate the key pair downloaded before.
run:
chmod 400 enter-the-ec2-key-name-here
ssh -i my-ec2-key-pair.pem ec2-user@<EC2-INSTANCE-PUBLIC-IP-ADDRESS>

substituting the names and ip address for the correct ones.
Now, Amazon Linux AMI should be up and running on this machine.

run:
[ec2-user]$ sudo yum update -y
[ec2-user]$ sudo yum install -y docker
[ec2-user]$ sudo service docker start

This gets Docker up and running on the server.

run:
[ec2-user]$ sudo usermod -a -G docker ec2-user
[ec2-user]$ exit

> ssh -i my-ec2-key-pair.pem ec2-user@<EC2-INSTANCE-PUBLIC-IP-ADDRESS>

This means that sudo is not needed for most commands.
